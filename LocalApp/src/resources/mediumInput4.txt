We were not sure how we would be able to make it through the holidays with no money to spend on gifts for each other. We decided we would not buy gifts, but I love Christmas so much I just had to buy her something. My wife's favorite thing in the world is her Banana, she loves it almost as much as I love my trusty, but dull and rusty knife. I've always wanted to allow my wife to be able to slice and eat that banana but with my inadequate knife I could never satisfy her banana needs. I finally decided I would do what is necessary to get her the best gift this Christmas. So I did it...I sold my knife. With the money I was able to get the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer for her on Christmas Eve. On Christmas morning we woke up and I reached under the bed to retrieve my special gift for my wife, surprisingly she seemed to be doing the same thing. When I turned over I saw her holding a gift.\"You shouldn't have!\" I said. \"I had to...\" she replied.We opened each others gifts and I was shocked to find in the box...a knife sharpener! When I looked up to tell her, I noticed tears in her eyes as she looked down at my gift. I asked her what was wrong.\"I sold my banana to buy you that knife sharpener.\"\"But I sold my knife to buy you that banana slicer.\"We laughed and cried and this memory has kept us going through years of marriage.When we were finally able to buy another banana, my wife finally confessed, that she liked her bananas cut the other way in long strips. So they really need to add an attachment or make a new model if they want to get 5 stars.","rating":4,"author":"Blair A.

The banana slicer helps maintain a consistent thickness for all the slices and provides a more even dehdration. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it would be nice if the slices were thinner.

Often when my stomach rumbles for potassium and substance I look to my banana with despair as I realize my duty knife will not suffice in cutting the banana into manageable road slices. Out of frustration I hook the banana to my gun belt until I feel I'll have enough time to slice it. This was a wonderful idea... Until the day I had to clear a building with a possible suspect inside. I went to draw my duty weapon but in my haste I drew the banana. Luckily I squished it hard enough that I was able to survive the situation as the unsheathed banana fired out like a projectile, dropping the suspect. Since I've acquired the the B571, this has never happened since, (thank God). Do not bring a banana to a gun fight, but do make room on your gun belt for the B571 banana slicer.","rating":5,"author":"Deputy's Review 4 U","date":"2013-02-28T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2JYN5LLWUJWPE","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JYN5LLWUJWPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Buyer beware: only for right bent bananas!","text":"What they don't tell you is that it is only for right bent bananas - that curve like this: ((All the bananas at my grocery store are left bent bananas - that curve like this: ))It's super frustrating because I went through a dozen bananas where it only sliced the bottom halves!","rating":1,"author":"DC Reader","date":"2013-04-04T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1EWH4JB3I2MZG","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EWH4JB3I2MZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"It slices!","text":"I purchased this mostly to get even slices for my food dehydrator.

Some people thought little Billy Epstein and I were gay, but we really took Home Ec class because that was where all the chicks were.  We learned a lot in that class - about life, our sexuality, pubescent females and food prep.  Our teacher, Ed Banapeel, was very competitive.  We sliced and we diced into all hours of the night practicing and hoping that we could all get full-ride scholarships to culinary schools.  Banapeel was certain that would elevate his program higher than the football and basketball programs combined.  He needed to find a competitive edge and one day found it on Amazon - the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  It was faster than anything we had seen before, and clean-up was a breeze.  However, the Hutzler 571 is so much more.Being adolescent males, we decided to sneak a Hutzler 571 out of the school to spend more time with it and realize its full potential.  We found ourselves in the Home Ec room at the precise moment when Banapeel's morning coffee kicked in and he made a beeline to the bathroom to lighten his load.  Little Billy grabbed the Hutzler 571 and jammed it down his pants in a flash.  We tried to make our way to the doorway without anybody noticing us, but little Billy caught the attention of every girl in the class (if you know what I mean).  As soon as we hit the hallway, we were off and running.  We knew we would get in trouble for skipping school, but we didn't care.  We had the Hutzler 571 and it was ours.  We made it all the way to little Billy's house.  We knew we were safe there because his parents both worked during the day.  His Mom was a Slinky tester and his Dad licked envelopes for the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes.  In all the excitement after we arrived at his house, little Billy pulled the Hutzler 571 out of his pants a little too quickly.  He is now a Eunuch.But our story doesn't end there.  We buried the Hutzler 571 in little Billy's backyard to avoid suspicion.  However, we had to keep burying it because several dogs and a raccoon kept digging it back up with all of the blood on it.  After little Billy had finally healed, we decided to see what the Hutzler 571 could do.  After all, we never got that chance before due to little Billy's misfortune.  As little Billy was lifting it from the ground, the dogs were all over it, so I grabbed it and threw it like a boomerang.  With amazing accuracy it went out about 100 yards and made a perfect turn and trajectory right back to my hand.  I didn't have to move.  It was just there.  Little Billy was awestruck.  He tried to do the same thing, but failed miserably (like most paper airplanes he made in his lifetime).  Not wanting him to feel bad, I told him that maybe we could play catch with it and use it like a frisbee instead of a boomerang.  Poor little Billy lost 2 fingers that day.  He was a good sport about it, but never picked up another Hutzler 571.So, I finally had the Hutzler 571 all to myself.  I took it out and continued using it like a boomerang and found my accuracy improving exponentially.  I started taking out pigeons in mid-flight and progressed to bats at dusk.  I was getting the attention of everyone on the neighborhood and crowds started forming to watch me use my new honed skills.  The crowds grew and grew even larger.  At first I was surprised to see the college scouts, but I was more impressed to learn that Hutzler was after me to found it's very own Hutzler 571 Boomerang League.  It was when the Secret Service showed up that I started to get scared.  I was afraid that old Banapeel was finally on to me and had figured out I had pinched the Hutzler 571.  That wasn't it at all.  They wanted me to go skeet shooting with Barack Obama.  Don't tell the POTUS, but he never hit a clay pigeon to save his life.  It was really me and my Hutzler 571 hiding off in the woods.","rating":5,"author":"WAM","date":"2013-04-06T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2PWV5GNRKFKLI","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PWV5GNRKFKLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Great Gag Gift","text":"Lots of fun with this as a gift, lots of laughing about it.

Plantain, a sole banana slicer was forged. Inscribed in the edge was the text \"Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. One slicer to rule them all. One banana to find them. One perfect wedge to bring them all, and without a knife slice them.\" The power was too much for mere mortals, and though they had innocent intentions, the power of perfect banana slices overcame them. One by one the mortals fell, and so it was determined: For the sake of mankind, the One Slicer had to be destroyed.It was quite by fate--and the will of a pothead--that I came across this product on Amazon. The reviews were good, so I bought it, but little did I know that soon my soul would be consumed by the ancient weapon of darkness. I eagerly awaited its arrival, contemplating the immense ease and efficiency with which I would soon be able to slice my bananas.Later that week, as I was practicing my turkey call, I suddenly heard a knock at the door. I leaped to my feet, anticipating the arrival of my beautiful banana slicer. I threw open the door, only to be greeted by a man in a gray robe. \"Do you have any spare towels?\" He inquired, \"This is my roommate's bathrobe and I already used the curtains last week.\" He forced his way in and made himself comfortable.He was a peculiar man who stood nearly seven feet tall and smelled of sweet cannabis. Shocked by his uninvited entrance, I stood there dumbly until another knock at the door shook me out of my stupor.It was the UPS man; he had come to deliver my precious banana slicer. I was about to sign for the package, when suddenly, my uninvited house guest pushed me aside and shouted with all his might, \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS!\".The UPS man looked absolutely horrified. Right as I was about to apologize, the man in robes pushed his way out of the door and took off down the street. \"That may be the strangest thing that has happened this week!\" I remarked. After asking me to sign for the package, the UPS man asked me for my autograph to give to his daughter, who was a huge fan of my turkey calling skills.Rushing inside as soon as I could, I stared at the package which I knew contained everything my heart desired. I clawed at the package, desperately trying to free the precious slicer--MY precious slicer--But the power that bound this box could not be undone. As I was clamoring for a method to unleash the power of my very own banana slicer, I was once again interrupted by the man in the robes.\"Don't open it!\" he shouted, as he barged through the door. \"The power that is contained in that box will unleash a barrage of evil that will consume all of mankind!\" Immediately after uttering these words, he collapsed on the carpet and did not come to for three days.When he regained consciousness, and the substance that clouded his mind had dissipated, he blurted out, \"Is it secret? Is it safe?\" Soon after, he proceeded to inform me of the ancient legend of this very banana slicer.\"It consumed the souls of every mortal who has ever tried to wield its power\" he said. \"The simplicity and perfection of the slicer corrupted the hearts of even the most honorable men. The ease with which it slices was far too much for this world, and soon its dark power covered the world with darkness.\"\"What can be done?\" I asked. I could feel the slicer calling to me, so I knew it was legit.\"We must return it from whence it came,\" he replied. \"Through the chasm of the Brooklyn Bridge, across Manhattan to the center of Connecticut, where the fires of Mt. Plantain still burn; the only fire hot enough to consume the slicer once and for all. It will be a long a perilous journey, not for the faint of heart.\"\"The slicer is my burden.\" I said solemnly, as I realized the sealing of my fate. Thus, I embarked on a journey that would forever change the fate of the world.","rating":5,"author":"Froyo Swaggins","date":"2014-09-12T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1R1X0TN9OS7SH","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R1X0TN9OS7SH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"One Star","text":"Too big of slices and not easy to clean.

It finally reached the point where I was loosing weight.  Trying to select the correct number of flakes, or even rice krispies, with inconsistent banana slices took so long my cereal would get mushy and who can eat that?  The heat of a Texas summer began to take its toll without the proper amount of potassium and my declining caloric intake.  One day I passed out while doing my morning chores.  The horses, dog, cats and chickens did not get fed.  They too started loosing weight.  The chickens became so weak they could not outrun the fox or coyotes.

One officer, being a kind, empathetic soul, slipped this banana slicer into my pocket - he understood my plight.  My world changed forever.  I could now eat my cereal lickety split.

I figured if the Hutzler could provide perfect banana servings in seconds, how would it work for other foods that need sliced when served?

Problem solved?Not so fast.So I realized I needed to reduce the overall cross section of the loaf. OK, fine. I simply mashed and squished my meatloaf into a thinner, more-banana like tube. After I baked our dinner, I was all ready to slice up some perfectly proportioned servings for the family. Upon pulling out my perfectly-browned confection, I located it upon a cutting board.What I saw horrified me. My creation, shaped solely due to my unbridled desire to multi-task my 571B, in all its moistened browness, had transformed in appearance. Maybe, like me, you had never thought what a banana-sized, cooked meatloaf would look like.Well, I am here to warn you: Meatloaf should never look the same before you eat it as it will when your body is done digesting it.

Sure, as long as you pick them up in 5 seconds or less, who's the wiser? But who can gather up 18 banana slices in 5 seconds?? Maybe if Amazon can get legislation passed to increase the 5-second rule ceiling to something like, oh say 20 seconds, this would be a useable product. I really don't see both sides of the aisle in Congress coming together to avoid the 5-second cliff though.Or perhaps Amazon could package it with something that can catch the banana slices and keep them off the floor...like a table, or counter-top or something like that. Solve this issue and you're talking about a 5-star product here!Until then, I guess I'll just have to make the kids kneel on the floor and catch the banana slices in their mouths as they fall.

I found myself eating all the right-handed bananas in my cereal while the lefties sat and browned. I'd eventually cut them up with a regular old knife and throw them in some banana bread or make some pudding.I know this is going to sound a little crazy, but my solution came through an accident. One day, while I was washing the dishes, I wasn't paying attention and my arm brushed against the Hutzler 571. I knocked it to the ground below. (THANKFULLY IT FELL ON A PADDED RUG AND DIDN'T BREAK. I MEAN, THEY ARE DURABLE, BUT WHAT A MOMENT OF PANIC!)I still can't explain it, but after it hit the ground, somehow the jarring motion switched it over. All of a sudden, I had a left-handed slicer. I immediately called my wife and when she got home, we each had 2 bowls of cereal, all with perfectly cut slices of our LEFT-HANDED bananas.Of course, then I had the same problem with all my right-handed bananas. I decided to try it again. (This time making sure it landed on the rug.) It didn't work. I was crushed, but something inside me said try again. I did. Still nothing. I tossed and turned all night.The next morning, this voice kept telling me to try the rug one more time. It was relentless. I couldn't give up.That third time, I still can't believe it, the slicer switched back to right-handed.I wondered if something supernatural had happened. But all my friends and family that I've bought these for have tried the same thing and IT WORKS! Some have used carpet in their living room, others have used bathroom rugs. My mother-in-law, who told me she'd never risk breaking it, later told my wife on the phone that she had tried it with a pillow and it worked.It isn't perfect, I'd say 50% - 60% of the time this method works. I can't explain how, and honestly I don't even care anymore.

Does Hutzer make a banana peeler? Sure, but don't go thinking it's included or, like me, you're gonna get your slicer and realize it's about as useful as a roll of paper towels without a paper towel dispenser until you pony up more cash and wait. (And, oh the wait feels endless.) Fortunately, or not, during my second purchase I had the foresight to consider what other essential \"upgrades\" I need just to make use of the original product.Let's just say that it all works beautifully, the banana scouring powder and polishing cloth, the peeler, the slicer, and the 13-head-rotating-banana-slicer-scrub-brush all deliver as promised, but I hope the excitement of flawless bananas on the kids' Christmas morning Cheerios is present enough from Santa this year. In fairness, the banana de-threader and banana seed extractor were probably unnecessary luxuries. But then again, were they? It's not as though I splurged on the titanium and redwood display case. (Honestly, at a quarter the price, the stainless steel and artisan-selected oak gets the job done without being unnecessarily ostentatious.)Part of me feels like we could have made due with just a cigar cutter, the appropriate violin strings, 1.25\" and 3.75\" duct tape, a repurposed loom and/or the spokes from the front wheel of a brass unicycle, a yard of bacteria-resistant crushed velvet, a baker's dozen of My Little Pony mane and tailbrushes, a set of resurfaced wooden dominoes, a pair of needle-nosed surgical-grade tweezers, and a well-trained midget. But hell, it was just one Christmas... unless the rumors about the upcoming release of Hutzer's Miracle Banana Spot Remover turn out to be true. The kids will understand.","rating":3,"author":"Amazon Customer","date":"2013-09-17T21:00:00.000Z"}]}

I’m a busy person and stressful, hectic mornings are not unusual to me; so taking the time out of my morning routine to ensure an evenly-sliced banana is often out of the question.Every morning I wake up at exactly 5:40 am to my Trans-Siberian Orchestra alarm, hop out of my futon and get dressed in the Pinterest-inspired pantsuit that I laid out the night before. Once I’m dressed I prepare breakfast for myself and Admiral Spikes-a-lot, my 3-month-old cactus that I’ve attached googly eyes to. And, well, that’s when my mornings become complicated. I’m often faced with the Sophie’s-choice-esque decision between suffering through the packing-peanut-crunch of plain, off-brand Cheerios or spending the necessary time to properly slice and distribute my banana into my breakfast; a feat that always leaves me three hours late for work at my terriers-only dog groomery.However, thanks to this innovative product, I have been able to add a perfectly sliced banana to my cereal EVERY DAY with ease, as well as only a 0.1 – 0.2 mm margin of error. I now have so much time in my morning routine that I have begun to take up knitting! I have so far made infinity scarves for eight of my eleven garden gnomes! The only complaint that comes to mine is that I can only purchase a 10-inch slicer online when many of the bananas I encounter at my local grocer are much more varied in size- I’d love some smaller and larger slicers as well so that I can have more variation in my banana sizes at breakfast.

When I inquired about other kids at school who have taken up \"nanner slicin'\" (probably what the kids are calling it), my sons just laughed at me and replied that slicing bananas is \"lame\".  I didn't want to throw the bananas away unsliced, so I sliced them all myself- it was quite exhilarating.

We decided on the Hutzler because it sounded more exotic and vaguely German.So, the day it arrived, we opened the package it was shipped in and easily identified the product.  That's when the fun began.  There was a piece of paper in the packaging, but it appeared to be just the packing slip.  There was not a trace of instructions to be found anywhere!  We must have stared at that packing list for an hour, passing it back and forth between us, convinced there were instruction on how to use the dang thing somewhere.  Eventually we gave up and had to learn to use it with trial and error.What a mess that was.  I will let you all in on what we learned:DO NOT try to stand the banana on end and slice it that way.  The stem will get stuck between the blades.  If you must try it this way, I suggest you get a knife and slice the stem off before using the tool.DO peel the banana first.  The blades are made of plastic and an unpeeled banana (especially a unripe one) will be horrific to try to slice with this tool.  If you must try it this way, I suggest you get a knife and score the banana peel lengthwise four times, rotating the banana as you do.DO NOT buy bananas in bunches at the grocery store. You need to buy them singly.  This is because ONLY HALF THE BANANAS IN THE STORE FIT IN THIS DAMN THING!  Look closely at the product picture; you will need to buy bananas that \"face\" to the right.  Ones that face left won't fit.  And make sure you lay them out in your shopping cart that way carefully; we have gotten home and realized that we thought we had purchased all \"righties\" but had a few \"lefties\" when we unloaded our groceries.  If you must try a \"leftie\", I suggest you get a knife and cut the banana in thirds, and then flip the top and bottom parts over so that the outcast banana appears to be a \"rightie\".Hope this helps!","rating":3,"author":"John Campbell","date":"2014-01-10T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1OXU12ZDJAVG1","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OXU12ZDJAVG1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Bought As A Joke, But It's A Good Tool","text":"I bought it to use to make dehydrated banana slices, but they are too thick when cut with this.

It may change your life, it certainly did mine!Nearly everyone, by now, is well attuned to the difficulties of banana preparation.Specifically the slicing aspect. It gets to the point where looking at a banana (or,heaven forbid, rack of bananas) can fill one with a sense of impending doom. Because you don't want to slice the banana. \"Ain't Nobody Got Time For That!\" The way I used to handle the situation, was to take a knife and... well... lets just say is was a process. Quite a number of seconds of my life down the drain! For each and every banana! I'm sure there are many who know what I am talking about.Enter the Hutzler 571.The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has been a Godsend. Now, instead of the complicated, messy, time consuming (and dangerous) knife-based preparation of my favorite yellow, slightly inappropriately shaped fruit, I can get perfect banana slices in a fraction of the time. I can honestly say this little miracle has shaved seconds off of my slicing time. Thank you Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer for giving me my life back. Now I have plenty of time on my hands to do all those little several-second tasks that have fallen by the wayside. For instance, turning off (and on) the lights, pouring milk and other beverages into a glass, putting on underwear, checking my rear view mirror before backing out, opening (and closing) the drapes, flossing my two lower molars, feeding the puppies, waving back at people, and yes, even the occasional romantic interlude with my wife. The Hutzler 571 has, quite literally, improved virtually every aspect of my life.The build quality of this product is phenomenal. All the intricate working parts are perfectly integrated. The array of slicing mechanisms are perfectly spaced and apparently self aline between uses. The Hutzler 571 is constructed of fine quality plastics and other materials. It looks like a Million Bucks! Visually pleasing to say the least; I would even use the term \"Work of Art.\" If Steve Jobs had devised a banana slicing device this would be it. (Of course the Apple version might be just a tad bit more user friendly... more on that later.) It is beyond me how they can offer the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer at this price point, high as it may be. Perhaps, in the future, they will charge for software updates (I hope not), or upgrades to the OS. Either way, don't be put off by the (seemingly) high cost, this machine is a gem and a bargain at twice the price. It might be tempting to wait and see if the price (currently at $1.29) drops by several percent, to say $1.19 or even $1.09. A substantial savings like that would be nice, but as I've said, I believe the $1.29 price to be more than fair.There IS a steep learning curve with this one. Short, but steep. It took me several days (weeks, actually) to master the techniques necessary to operate this marvel. In fact I could stand to hone my skills further which I plan to do with continuing use. Nevertheless I was (mostly) successfully slicing bananas in under a day of trial and error. Common missteps could have been avoided with an included instructional video. Or such a video, or more appropriately, series of videos, could be sold separately. At any rate, mistakes are unavoidable early on.Reading up on this and other online forums may help. For instance, try to avoid these common (rookie, ha just kidding) mistakes: attempting to slice the banana in an improper orientation (such as lengthwise or \"lefthanded\"), slicing an unpeeled or partially unpeeled banana (the pealed portion may actually slice, but at the expense of the unpeeled portion), using non-banana fruits (such as watermelons, pumpkins, or plantains), pressing down with zero force, attempting to press the banana through the Hutzler 571 onto the counter, trying to process more than one banana at a time (such as four or six at once), sending the banana through the Hutzler 571 repeated times (in some cased this can work but you have to be extremely accurate), attempting to \"turn on\" the Hutzler 571 before use (it turns on by itself AND seems to turn off a few minutes after use), slicing the banana with a knife first, and lastly (this got me quite a few times) not pounding the bananas into a smooth pulp with a curtain rod before using the Hutzler 571. I would suggest purchasing eight to ten pounds of bananas to practice on at first, until you get the hang of it. That way when the time comes should you actually need banana slices, you will not be fiddling around unsuccessfully in the heat of the moment (e.g. while your cereal is getting soggy, ice cream is melting or guests are waiting).[Edit: some have said it is possible to process plantains under certain circumstances however my repeated attempts were unsuccessful and I would not recommend it!]In closing, If I had $35.00 for every time the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer got me out of a banana slicing jam I would be a financially better off person right now, I can tell you that! But even without such hypothetical monetary stimulation, my life is fuller due to this wonderful product; and I whole-heartedly recommend the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer to any one with banana slicing needs.Now if they could just invent a device that would enable the easy transfer of butter onto bread (other than the awful knife system I use now!) ...

Banana trees are remarkably resistant to nuclear radiation as well as the shrieks of the dying and dead. The banana is the perfect fruit.

It's freezer safe, dishwasher safe, can be washed in hot and cold water, contains no metal so I could take it with me when I visit my family in prison.Another great feature that I love is when you're not in the mood to eat a banana, you can use this as a stencil to draw a banana.  Stripes and all!","rating":4,"author":"Giant","date":"2012-12-21T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1P5DBMPBE17VT","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P5DBMPBE17VT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"A Handy Kitchen Tool, or an Apocalyptic Nightmare Descent into the Mouth of Madness (or both)?","text":"When I first saw this product, I felt a euphoric sense of relief, thinking a life-long problem had been resolved.  But instead of salvation, the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has brought me nothing but bitter frustration and despondency.Before I go any further, I would like to voice my objection to the obviously euphemistic and wholly inappropriate product description on the Amazon page - \"Kids love slicing their own bananas\".  Really, Hutzler?  You left out, \"Nudge, nudge, wink, wink!\"  Shame on you.Now, I should point out that I have benefitted from other banana-assistive technology.  I have been using the Apogee Banana Peeler BPX52Z for several years.  But this product, effective as it is, as far as it goes, leaves the user with a still-intact fruit dog.  What to do?  So, after years of having to throw away hundreds of unsliced (and therefore, obviously inedible) bananas, along comes Hutzler to the rescue.  I knew I must have this technological marvel, no matter what the cost.After months living a Spartan existence and saving every penny, I finally amassed enough money to cover the purchase price.  When the box finally arrived at my door, I was so elated that I kissed the UPS driver.  On the lips.  Needless to say, I was happy and excited.  I was glad to get my banana slicer, too.After gleefully tearing through the packing materials, I was shocked to discover that my 571 came with no, I repeat, NO instruction manual.  How the hell am I supposed to figure this out myself?!  Hey Hutzler - not everyone is a University of Phoenix graduate, you know?Fortunately, my next door neighbor has a Spider monkey, Peanut, who was able to demonstrate proper operation of this device.  So, great - all that ends well is well, right?  Not this time.As mentioned, intentionally or not, no instruction manual was included.  Nonetheless, I've mastered the slicing procedure (thanks to Peanut).  But now, how do I get the freshly-sliced fruit disks from the plate to my mouth?  I've asked Peanut to show me, but he always puts them in HIS mouth, which does me no good.Does Hutzler also offer a Banana Slice Plate-To-Mouth Guidance System?  It is simply cruel to take people half-way there, and then mock them by leaving them helplessly staring at a plate of sweet (I can only assume, of course) slices.By proffering the 571 Banana Slicer, is Hutzler truly attempting to help humanity, or is this nothing more than a sadistic joke, meant to exploit the limitations of human cognition and perseverance, and the fragility of emotion?  Are they part of some nefarious collusive plot, along with Apogee, to drive the human race mad, one banana lover at a time??So what's your deal, Hutzler?  What other instruments of torture do you brutes have in that treacherous treasure trove you call a product line?  Bottomless mugs?  Pencils with erasers on both ends?  Hornet-filled piñatas?  You vicious bastards!While I am grateful for the new relationship that has blossomed with Carl (the UPS guy), no other good has come of this purchase, and l feel Hutzler needs to make this right, not just for me, but for everyone.To all other victims of this mean-spirited chicanery (Chiquitery?), if we do not soon receive satisfaction, I suggest we file a class action suit, to \"peel\" away the façade, and expose the conspiracy.  This isn't a banana republic.  This is America, dammit!  Let the revolution begin here...Now, then...were the manufacturer to see their way clear to send me one of those Banana Slice Plate-To-Mouth Guidance Systems for free (WITH INSTRUCTIONS), I'm sure we could put all this ugliness behind us.  The banana's in your court, Hutzler...","rating":4,"author":"K.

Now I have the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!

See, in Soviet Germany, we have a saying, \"Slice a Banana or be buried in a shallow grave as a traitor to our Soviet Overlords.\"  We tried for years to invent something to compete with the Western Germans and NATO, and even the USA using coat hangers and razor blades.  Crude but effective.  Unfortunately, razor blades were hard to come by in Soviet Germany so alternatives were needed.  We tried to use wire thinking this would be thin and durable but we found the wires would not stay in place causing the slices to be uneven and not to WESTERN standards.  So then we used welding equipment, Steel from the Ural Mountains, and the spirit of the Soviet Bear and came up with an Industrial slicer that was about 24 metric tons but worked like a Chopin Symphony.  We created almost 1,000,000 units of this slicer before the end of the cold war and we felt that we did everything possible to make our lives full and complete.  When I saw this slicer, I felt an urge to kill myself like no other.  Even when the Soviet KGB held me in a prison of pain for 5 years, I never felt like giving up like I did when I saw this device.  So simple, and light and perfect.  I have no desire to live anymore but I still gave the product 3 stars because its still amazing.  Now, heed my words and know that in some countries, we are not blessed with technology like this and for us, it breaks our spirit.","rating":3,"author":"Hans Weinfurter","date":"2016-10-05T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R10C1IC229KRZ5","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10C1IC229KRZ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Everything I intended it to be","text":"I think that the banana slicer, which turned out to be  I expected to be exactly what I intended, is perfect.","rating":4,"author":"Dan Kauble","date":"2013-02-07T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R27RB68YEFLBIE","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27RB68YEFLBIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Useful item!","text":"Very handy to have, makes using bananas easy to prepare for all kinds of dishes.
